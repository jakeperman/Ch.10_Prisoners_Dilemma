NOTES:

Prisoners_Dilemma.py allows hard-coding of different strategies
for the Iterative Prisoners Dilemma, the classic game of game-theory.
Each strategy plays 100 to 200 rounds against each other's strategy.
The results of all previous rounds within a 100-200 round stretch are known
to both players.

Pressing the green arrow button will allow you to run the tournament and
store the output in tournament.txt

Teams should each code their strategies in their assigned section of code.
